# node-red-contrib-socialogix_edison_rgblcd

A Node-RED node to write strings to Grove RGB LCD

- v1.0.0 initial version - buggy - it seems that using | in "category" will hide all nodes
- v1.0.1 first working version - though starting x/y pair not quite right - linked to CSS .x, .y
- v1.0.2 split starting point (0,y) to (row, col)
